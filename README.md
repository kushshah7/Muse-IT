# Muse-IT
Utilized an Electroencephalogram (EEG) device (MUSE Headband) to convert brain activity (electrical impulses) to electrical signals. The signals were analyzed and parsed using MUSELab and Museio. An algorithm was developed in C# using Visual Studio, which uses the eye blink activity signal that was parsed from MUSELab to trigger an activity on the computer (E.g, Opening up an application, playing and pausing music). Future goals for this project include integration with Spotify to play music depending on the user mood using alpha and beta waves from the Muse Headband.
